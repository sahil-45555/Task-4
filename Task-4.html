    <h3>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was born on October 15,
    1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.<br><br>
    ☛ He served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.<br><br>
    ☛ Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in
    1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).<br><br>
    ☛ In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-
    III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India.<br><br>
☛ Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles,which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.”<br><br>
☛ Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated
aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.<br><br>
☛ He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.<br><br>
☛ From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal
scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister.<br><br>
☛ His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and
established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international
community.<br><br>
☛ In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a
road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called
for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for
economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.<br><br>
